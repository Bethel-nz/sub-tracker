**# Solidity Subscription Tracker**

This project implements a smart contract-based subscription management system on the Ethereum blockchain, where users can subscribe to a service for a defined period and track their subscription status.

**Key Features**

- **Subscription Management:** Allows users to subscribe to a service for a set duration.
- **Expiration Tracking:** Manages subscription expiry, enabling the implementation of renewal logic or other actions.
- **On-Chain Data:** Stores subscription data securely and transparently on the blockchain.
- **Potential Extensions:** Provides a foundation for adding features such as:
  - Payment gateways for real-world subscriptions
  - Access control and restrictions based on subscription status

**Prerequisites**

- **Node.js and npm (or yarn):** You'll need a JavaScript runtime environment. Check [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Hardhat:** A development framework for Ethereum. See [https://hardhat.org/](https://hardhat.org/)
- **MetaMask (or similar):** A browser extension wallet to interact with the blockchain.

**Setup**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>
   cd <repo-name>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   yarn install  # Or npm install
   ```

**Configuration**

1. **Create a `.env` file:** Add the following environment variables:
   ```
   PRIVATE_KEY=<your-private-key>
   ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=<your-etherscan-api-key>
   CHAIN_ID=<testnet-or-mainnet-chain-id>
   ```
   - **Important:** Never expose your private key publicly.
2. **Update `hardhat.config.ts`:** Configure the networks and compilers as needed for your desired deployment targets.

**Compiling the Contract**

```bash
yarn hardhat compile
```

**Deploying the Contract**

1. **Choose a Network:** Select a testnet (like Goerli, Sepolia) or mainnet.
2. **Deploy Script:**
   ```bash
   yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network <chosen-network>
   ```

## Future updates and notes

**Interacting with the Contract**

- **Web3 Frontend:**I might Develop a frontend to interact with the contract using libraries like Ethers.js or Web3.js.

**Additional Notes:**

- If you have more sophisticated usage scenarios, provide examples.
